# Advanced Digital Design with the Verilog HDL (Micheal D. Ciletti)
# Chapter 1: Introduction to Digital Design Methodology

- Language-based designs: portable, independent of tech, allowing to modify & reuses.
- HDL-based synthesis is now a dominant design paradigm used by industry
- Verilog and VHDL languages, both are IEEE standards and FPGAs.
- Hybrid languages (e.g. Verilog-A) are used in designing mixed-signal circuits (have both digital and analog circuitry).
- System-level design languages (e.g. SystemC, Superlog) are now emerging to support a higher level of design abstraction than can be supported by Verilog/VHDL.
